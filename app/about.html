<!--
Canada 150: Canada’s Untold Stories is a national, not-for-profit collaborative campaign to celebrate Canada's 150th birthday in 2017 by encouraging Canadians to record their short and full-length life, family and community histories. 

Founded by Harry van Bommel on July 1, 1997 and coordinated by Legacies Inc., the project is the largest history-gathering project in Canada. Working with hundreds of organizations across Canada and reaching Canadians internationally, the project will reach out to Canadians of every age, background and experience.  
Mission Statement
Canada 150 will engage Canadians in a celebration of their past and future by encouraging them to record the stories of their lives, their families and their communities for the benefit of future generations. We will make it enjoyable and straightforward for these irreplaceable memories to be documented and then gathered in an unprecedented collection, mostly online and available to researchers and family historians in perpetuity. 

Values
BulletCollaboration
BulletInclusiveness
BulletTransparency

BulletTechnological and Archival Rigour

Vision
Imagine Parliament Hill on July 1, 2017. Amidst the other celebrations all visible on a giant screen, the Governor-General pushes a button that officially launches the country’s largest online collection of the stories of everyday people in all walks of life, all readily searchable by keyword. 
This ceremony is the culmination of a twenty-year project that engaged Canadians from coast to coast to coast in a myriad of national and grassroots programs to record their memories and their histories, both to celebrate the past in the present and to create an unparalleled resource for the future. 
The young will be encouraged to interact with their elders to learn about their pasts. Those in institutions, such as the elderly, will be interviewed about their memories. Aboriginal groups will share their histories and wisdom, as will veterans and their families, community groups and corporations. Everyone’s story will be solicited, regardless  of age, racial or religious origin, mother tongue, financial status or physical well-being.
To provide flexibility and reliable infrastructure for this celebration, Canada 150 has sourced rock-solid technology and has integrated state-of-the-art archival principles into the design of our programs. The resulting database will be robust, scalable, adaptable, easy to update and a breeze to access. Appropriate measures will safeguard privacy and copyright.
None of this would have happened without Canada 150, a national, not-for-profit group established not only to pursue the mission but also to facilitate the pursuit of the mission by all of our partner organizations.

Goals
BulletTo retain our wealth of oral, written and visual history for generations to come in repositories available to everyone worldwide.
BulletTo provide a family legacy for generations to come.
BulletTo improve understanding within families and communities through the mutual exchange of stories.
BulletTo enhance Canadian unity through a sense of national pride and a more profound celebration of the contributions of Canadians from diverse backgrounds.

Objectives
Generally: 

1.to be the largest nation-building project in this or any other country and thus to celebrate both Canadian unity and patriotism with respect for diversity,
2.to engage millions of Canadians in a consideration of the past and future and to improve understanding within families and communities, 
3.to be memorable beyond 2017 and to create a rich resource of primary materials, both oral and written, available in perpetuity.

Specifically Canada 150 will collect short and full-length histories through:

BulletMemories [uploads of photos and one-to-two paragraph stories about a specific event or family]

BulletOne-of-a-Kind unpublished collections of letters, journals, diaries, films, scrapbooks 

BulletPublished books, films, songs, plays, websites, multimedia platforms

Types of Stories
If something is important in the lives of people, its story should be recorded. Stories may be: 

1.An individual's stories,
2.Family stories, histories and genealogies,
3.Neighbourhood, community, municipality, county and regional histories,
4.Corporate histories,
5.Stories and histories from faith communities and their places of worship,
6.Histories of social clubs, associations, universities and colleges, arts and sports groups, educational institutions and more.

Scope
The project will reach out to all Canadians (both inside and outside of Canada) and encourage them to use all mediums available to them. Our goal remains to collect and preserve these stories so the final products must be either in a published format or a digital one. There will be no creative limits to the submissions as Canadians are a wonderfully diverse and creative population.

Target Audiences
As Canada’s largest history gathering project ever, we must be inclusive to fulfill our scope. Special emphasis is needed to reach the broadest audience possible including:
1.youth,
2.elders,
3.boomers,
4.aboriginal groups,
5.linguistic and cultural audiences, 
6.veterans,
7.community groups, 
8.corporations,
9.women's groups,
10.at-risk groups,
11.and as many others as we can bring together.

Funding
Canada 150 will be funded in two ways:

1.Canadians already are paying for their own computers, software, print-on-demand books, video recorders, scrapbooks, CDs, websites, etc. We will offer them encouragement, a database to find local resources that can help them, and a place to put these records, in perpetuity, as all of our gifts to Canada on its 150th birthday. 
2.Governments (all levels), granting agencies (e.g., foundations), and corporations will be asked  to provide funding to co-ordinate this largest history-gathering project in Canadian history. As well they may help fund local and national programs that make special efforts to reach those Canadians who are less likely to record their stories without help and provide some of the equipment, such as digital scanners, to help communities record their local photos, films and documents in perpetuity.
