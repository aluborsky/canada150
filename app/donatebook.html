            <p class="p-heading">Canada, like most countries, has a national library and archive. In the USA it is called the Library of Congress. In Canada it is called <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Library and Archives Canada</a>.</p>

            <p>By law if you publish more than 100 copies of your work, 2 copies of any published book, CD and DVD must be donated to Library and Archives Canada. If you publish less than 100 copies, you only need send in 1 copy.</p>

            <p><strong>What is a published book?</strong></p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp;Typically books are at least 40 pages long although some children’s books or family histories can be shorter.</p> 

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp;The book must have a binding but what type is not relevant. Keep in mind you want your book to last forever, so a good binding is necessary (including glued and cerlox binding). Staples or binders are not accepted.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp;You do not need an ISBN number for your book. An ISBN number is the unique number you will find in books published and sold in bookstores or online at places like amazon.com. If you would like to get a free ISBN number, the Library and Archives provide that for you.</p> 

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp;If you like, you can also contact Library and Archives Canada to get a free CIP listing. This process requires an ISBN number and some information about the content of your book. When the librarians receive a form from you, they give your book three different numbers for libraries to use to store your book on their shelves. They give you a Dewey Decimal number, a Library of Congress number and a Canadian University number. They also summarize the book’s content by category. If you donate your book to your local library, this would be a very helpful thing to include on your copyright page. Again, look at any book in the library or book store (or your own bookshelf) on the copyright page to see what this looks like. If you would like this free service, check out <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/cip/Pages/CIP-Trade-Publishers-Form.aspx" target="_blank">Library and Archives Canada</a>.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp;You must print off at least 4 copies for it to be considered published and, therefore, requiring you to donate a copy to Library and Archives Canada.</p> 

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>&nbsp;Books produced for the Canada 150: Canada’s Untold Stories project are considered to be “public” and therefore eligible for Library and Archives Canada. If you printed less than 4 books and keep them at home and did not give or show them to others, then it would be considered “private.”</p>


            <p><strong>Now that you know the rules, here is how you can send your books. It is only a two-step process!</strong></p>

            <p>BEFORE printing your book, on the title page inside the book and on the copyright pages (see any book on your bookshelves to see what pages these are in any book), please add the words: <strong>CANADA 150 Series</strong></p>

            <p>In this way, Library and Archives Canada can catalogue the book as part of this project’s collection. This will make it easier for your family and descendants to find your book and it will allow us to keep track of how many books were donated as part of this gift to Canada on its 150th birthday!</p>

            <p>Use the <a href="legalform.html">attached form</a> to send in your book to Library and Archives Canada. By using the form, you guarantee that your book becomes part of the Canada 150 Series.</p>
